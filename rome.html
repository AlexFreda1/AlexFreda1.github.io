<h1>Rome</h1> 

        <h3>There are amazingly intact ruins from the time of the Roman Empire, like the Colosseum, the Forum and Palatine Hill, and Nero's Domus Aurea. The Rome Colosseum is one of its most famous landmarks, and one of the best reasons to visit Rome all by itself! I personally love rome due to its great story behind it!</h3>

<h3>I absolutely loved Rome for its mix of ancient history and lively atmosphere. The famous landmarks like the Colosseum and Trevi Fountain were breathtaking. Walking through the bustling streets with cozy cafes and lively markets was always exciting. Above all, the friendly people made me feel welcomed and added to the city's charm.</h3>
