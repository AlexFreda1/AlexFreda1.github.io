        <h3>First, and most peoples favorite we have pizza! Pizza's were made in many different ways with many different toppings in Italy but it still tastes amazing. The pizza shown in the image is called Neapolitan pizza, it is a style of pizza made with tomatoes and mozzarella cheese, The tomatoes must be either San Marzano tomatoes or pomodorini del Piennolo del Vesuvio, and the cheese must be mozzarella di bufala campana!</h3>

<h3>Now on the topic of the deserts in the photo, there is a gelato, which is the common word in Italian for all types of ice cream. In English, it specifically refers to a frozen dessert of Italian origin. And lastly, an espresso, it is a concentrated form of coffee produced by forcing hot water under high pressure through finely-ground coffee beans. Fun fact, with espresso originating in Italy, espresso has become one of the most popular coffee-brewing methods worldwide!</h3>
